<h1>Aaron Kahen's Biography</h1>

<p>My name is Aaron Kahen. I'm a senior at Tufts University majoring in Economics and minoring in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in figuring out how things work as well and creating new things in the process. Upon graduation, I plan to get a job in either data analysis or programming before I take the LSATs and go to law school. </p>

<p>In my spare time, I music direct the Jewish a cappella group on campus, Shir Appeal. This includes leading rehearsals, as well as arranging music. </p>
